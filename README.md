Install an Upfront starter theme, customize or completely rebuild it to your liking, and see your edits in real-time. It's not just a page builder limited by boxes, slide controls and dials, modify any element to any degree with complete design control.

### Upfront's Tools Make Customization Easy

Upfront uses elements and regions to give you maximum flexibility when building your site. It's unlike any WordPress theme you've ever used. Each element is built for fine-grain adjustments, from built-in option to custom styles.

### Flexible Styling

Control individual elements AND globally manage style across your entire site. Add theme colors, adjust typography and manipulate global settings without a single line of code.

### JUMBO RESPONSIVE VIDEO

Use wall-to-wall video to showcase your work. Upfront makes it easy to embed looping background video or share your latest blockbuster.
